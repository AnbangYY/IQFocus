comments:
  - using setImage to set the path of picture
  - using setFitWidth to set the width of picture
  - using setFitHeight to set the height of picture
  - using setLayoutX and Y to set the starting position
  - At last using root.getchildren to get child node to show the picture
  - Through these methods, the basic implementation of small blocks of display, pieces can be displayed on the game board.But the main features were not implemented.
  - Can use a loop to implement the show of picture to improve the efficiency of code.
  - As shown above, Anbang's code is highly readable.
