comments:
  - First part of code creates a method makePieces(), which puts tile pieces into the viewer window. This code is
  - commented with its utility, and the method name is stated clearly. Hence this code is well-documented.
  - In this piece of code, the best feature is the for loop of makePieces(). The for loop gives makePieces() method the
  - ability to put every piece into the board, rather than creating one method for each piece. This makes the code
  - neater.
  - Plus, there are methods such as makeBoard() and makeControl(), makeBoard can add class board and make board show in
  - viewer window and makeControl helps to add class control into the game and make pieces interactable. These 3 methods
  - are consistent with their naming and java conventions, as the first alphabet of first word is lower cased and the
  - first alphabet of second word is upper cased. And all three methods will be called in the main method when the game
  - runs.
  - The idea of generating different methods for different functionalities makes the code more readable.
